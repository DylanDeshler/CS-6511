numpy is the only non-standard library needed to run water_jug_v3.py.

Call it with either option:
python path/to/water_jug_v3.py random

This will generate sets of random test cases and evaluate the algorithm on them while outputting some metrics.

python path/to/water_jug_v3.py path/to/test_case.txt

This will run the algorithm on the test case.
